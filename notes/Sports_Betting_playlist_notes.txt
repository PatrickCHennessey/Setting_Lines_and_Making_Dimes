Video #3: How to Bet on Sports - A Complete Beginners Guide to Straight Bets and Parlays with NFL Week 2 Picks
by Zach Rosas

- Determine your bankroll (how much you're willing to lose)
- 1 unit = 1% of your bankroll
- Max you should ever wager on a bet is = 5% of bankroll

Different types of Bets:
	- Against the Spread (ATS) 
		- NFL Example: Patriots (+3.5) vs Seahawks (-3.5), 
		- Seahawks are the Favorite, indicated by the "-" 
		- If betting on the Seahawks, then the Seahawks MUST win by 4 or more points for you to win the bet.
		- Patriots are the Underdog, indicated by the "+" 
		- If betting on the Patriots, then the Patriots MUST fulfill at least one of the two following conditions:
			- 1. Patriots win the game. 
			- 2.The final score is Seattle Seahawks 20, NE Patriots 17 + 3.5 = 20.5. 
					In this example, the Patriots still lose the game straight up, but they win against the spread.
		
	- Moneyline 
		- NFL Example: Patriots (+170) vs Seahawks (-190)
		- Opposite of the Spread: "+" indicates the Underdog, while "-" indicates the Favorite
		- Using a $100 bet betting on Patriots (+170)
			- If Patriots win 
				- The principle or amount you bet = $100 in this scenario
				- Additionally you win $170 per $100 bet, $170 in this scenario
				- Total winnings = $270 
		- Using a $100 bet betting on Seahawks (-190)
			- If Seahawks win 
				- The principle or amount you bet = $100 in this scenario
				- Additionally you win $100 per $190 bet, so 100/190 = ~ $52.63 in this scenario
				- Total winnings = $152.63
				
	- Over/Under
		- Total Points scored 
	
	- Parlays
		- MUST satisfy multiple conditions to win bet, if one condition is missed than you lose the bet.
		- Riskier but higher payout
